Ever been to a mechanics shop and not sure how much that you are going to have to pay? It is awful and car issues can really put a dent in your budget.

We are creating a way where you can easily get quotes from multiple garages or private mechanics without leaving your home (Or the side of the road).

Web app (and eventually android and IOS) to let a user find mechanics near them and get quotes. The fire of the whole app is to allow a user to upload images and explain what is wrong
and then have mechanic shops give them quotes.


The MVP will start as a way to connect customers with auto shops and/or private mechanics by just having a database of customers and mechanics. Customers can find mechanics by zip.
